# Chichester House Price Prediction
This is task about predicting the house prices in Chichester district. The dataset provided has features like 'Price', 'Street', 'Postcode',
'Property_Type', 'Old_New', etc. My task is to do Exploratory analysis on the given data and applying models to predict the prices of house. Then researching and enriching
the model with socio-demo/economical data.

## Steps followed for prediction -
* Exploratory analysis on the given dataset(stats, correlations, etc)
* Visualizations for understanding data
* cleaning data to apply models (LASSO, Elastic Net, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, LGBMRegressor)
* Improvising performance of models
* Adding socio-demo/economical data
